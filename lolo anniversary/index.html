<h1><b>Relationship bio</b></h1>
<body>
    <p>I had told her before that i love her but  by that time  she thought <br>
 i was joking and didn't take it a serious matter like a gentleman, respected <br>
her decision,But it was not too far till we became good friends slowly by slowly <br>
    by slowly we became closer and everytime we became close that was my  <br>
    happiness.</p>
    <p><em>But because that crush i had in my heart all the time used to hurt me<br>
I couldnot keep it for long so,one day it was in the afternoon this day 28th, <br>
i told her how much i cherished her and wanted to be with her till whenever.<br>
its been just a month but we have felt even morethan you think its just a<br>
month i am thankful and grateful to God who give me this angel to be with me <br>
on this day and every second i have spend with her gives me joy and i pray we not<br>
only last long but forever and when i have married her and we are togther for <br>
all our life that would be the most happiest moment of my life.</em></p>

<h2><b>can you try to describe how you love her and what you expect from her?</b></h2>
<p>Well, you also know its not that easy to describe the love i have for her<br>
because if they were words then i think it could be the longest novel<br>
if am to describe it am going to describe it like this;<br>
think of the way u see the sky but u cant touch even when u reach it <br>
u cant touch so my love  for her is as high as that</p>
